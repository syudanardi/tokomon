Collect your favorite Pokemons in this simple app!

Simply open [https://tokomon-survi.web.app/](https://tokomon-survi.web.app/) don't worry its mobile friendly!

## Features

Pokemon Collection: Capture a pokemon to your collection or release it if you want!

Naming: Each of your captured pokemon can be named, multiple pokemon of the same species can't have the same name though!

## Notes

1. Tokomon is PWA (Progressive Web APP), Install it on mobile for similar experience to native app!

2. Your collection are stored in local storage (will be kept as long you don't clear the app data), but the loaded pokemon list are stored in session storage (will be cleared when you close your browser or app)

3. Hosted in firebase and relies on [graphql-pokeapi](https://github.com/mazipan/graphql-pokeapi) for Pokemons data

4. If you want to develop this project I already have some testing set up utilizing [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).
